Wishing my wife a happy birthday in a different way every year.

> nothing fancy or pretty, but just something for my wife to view on the morning of her birthday.

This year I decided to go a bit overboard and build my wife a game wishing her a happy birthday. I normally pay some guy on Fiverr to make her a birthday rap/song video, but this year I wanted to do something different.

Other than a small game making class in university, I've never made a game before. I came across [happy-birthday-orly](http://happy-birthday-orly.herokuapp.com/) and really liked the idea. Thankfully I had bookmarked [GDevelop](https://gdevelop-app.com/) in the past, and I'm really greatful I had because it was a really great app, and made the game really easy/fun to build, all in HTML5 out the box, too!

### Game/levels
- I had never used GDevelop before, so it was quite an interesting learning curve, but nothing that a few YouTube videos couldn't solve. Thankfully GDevelop have a pretty decent starter [platformer](https://editor.gdevelop-app.com/?project=example://platformer) game. I took this as a starter and basically put my own twist on it. I think I used a small percentage of what is capable with GDevelop.

### Artwork
- I had some custom pixel art comissioned from an [artist](https://www.fiverr.com/benrittmann/make-16bit-sprites-for-rpgs) on Fiverr, sprites images of my wife, myself, and my animals all in various poses. We all live in Miller Beach, Gary, Indiana, alongside 5 miles of beautiful beaches surrounded by nature preserves and dunes, so I also had the Chicago skyline, sand dunes/beach, life guard stations, and Lake Michigan comissioned for the background/other game elements.
- Everything else (such as [http://pixelartmaker.com/art/1988cf38a6851a9](wasp), [http://pixelartmaker.com/art/983920fd6d75d25](worm)) was from http://pixelartmaker.com/, another awesome resource

### Music/sounds
- To finish the game off, and not breaking the previous years streak, I had another [rap comissioned](https://www.fiverr.com/burtonm6/record-a-rap-verse-or-hook) by the same guy as previous years.
- Background music by PlayOnLoop.com Licensed under [Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
- The hardest part was trying to get our cats to meow on recording. I was able to lift 1 cat's hiss during one of their scraps I had recorded, and the other cat is a Siamese and sounds like a gargoyle, just not on demand. Our dog barks on demand, capturing his was a doddle. 

### Location
We live in Miller Beach, Gary, Indiana.
> Home to some of the world's most threatened ecosystems, Miller Beach contains a high proportion of legally protected land. Miller encompasses the westernmost part of Indiana Dunes National Park, which is part of the United States National Park system, and includes both the Miller Woods and Long Lake areas. Indiana Dunes' West Beach area lies immediately to the east of Miller Beach. The entire shoreline of Miller is public beachfront.

We love where we live and can't recommend it enough. I get to walk my 13 year old Chihuahua on the beach every day, every day/season is different, everyone is in the same chill mode. I really recommend Captain's House, Tequila and Tacos, Miller Pizza, Flamingo Pizza. From Millenium Station in downtown Chicago, the Miller Station of the South Shore Line train will take you to downtown Miller Beach, with Marquette Park Beach and various trails being a 30 minute walk away.

Also, while you're here, shameless plug, but check out this [community air monitor](millerbeach-air.com) I've hacked together to bring awareness to the local air quality in Miller Beach, considering we're in the middle of the largest steel making complex in the US.
